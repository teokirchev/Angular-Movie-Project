    <h1>Disney History</h1>
    <p>Walt Disney arrived in California in the summer of 1923 with a lot of hopes but little else. He had made a
        cartoon in Kansas City about a little girl in a cartoon world, called Alice’s Wonderland, and he decided that he
        could use it as his “pilot” film to sell a series of these “Alice Comedies” to a distributor. Soon after
        arriving in California, he was successful. A distributor in New York, M. J. Winkler, contracted to distribute
        the Alice Comedies on October 16, 1923, and this date became the start of the Disney company. Originally known
        as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, with Walt Disney and his brother, Roy, as equal partners, the company
        soon changed its name, at Roy’s suggestion, to the Walt Disney Studio.</p>
    <p>Walt Disney made his Alice Comedies for four years, but in 1927, he decided to move instead to an all-cartoon
        series. To star in this new series, he created a character named Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Within a year, Walt
        made 26 of these Oswald cartoons, but when he tried to get some additional money from his distributor for a
        second year of the cartoons, he found out that the distributor had gone behind his back and signed up almost all
        of his animators, hoping to make the Oswald cartoons in his own studio for less money without Walt Disney. On
        rereading his contract, Walt realized that he did not own the rights to Oswald—the distributor did. It was a
        painful lesson for the young cartoon producer to learn. From then on, he saw to it that he owned everything that
        he made.</p>
    <p>The original Disney Studio had been in the back half of a real estate office on Kingswell Avenue in Hollywood,
        but soon Walt had enough money to move next door and rent a whole store for his studio. That small studio was
        sufficient for a couple of years, but the company eventually outgrew it, and Walt had to look elsewhere. He
        found an ideal piece of property on Hyperion Avenue in Hollywood, built a studio, and in 1926, moved his staff
        to the new facility.</p>
    <p>It was at the Hyperion Studio, after the loss of Oswald, that Walt had to come up with a new character, and that
        character was Mickey Mouse. With his chief animator, Ub Iwerks, Walt designed the famous mouse and gave him a
        personality that endeared him to all. Ub animated two Mickey Mouse cartoons, but Walt was unable to sell them
        because they were silent films, and sound was revolutionizing the movie industry. So, they made a third Mickey
        Mouse cartoon, this time with fully synchronized sound, and Steamboat Willie opened to rave reviews at the
        Colony Theater in New York November 18, 1928. A cartoon star, Mickey Mouse, was born. The new character was
        immediately popular, and, a lengthy series of Mickey Mouse cartoons followed.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Not one to rest on his laurels, Walt Disney soon produced another series—the Silly Symphonies—to go with
                the
                Mickey series. It featured different casts of characters in each film and enabled animators to
                experiment
                with stories that relied less on the gags and quick humor of the Mickey cartoons and more on mood,
                emotion,
                and musical themes. Eventually the Silly Symphonies turned into the training ground for all Disney
                artists
                as they prepared for the advent of animated feature films. Flowers and Trees, a Silly Symphony and the
                first
                full-color cartoon, won the Academy Award® for Best Cartoon for 1932, the first year that the Academy
                offered such a category. For the rest of that decade, a Disney cartoon won the Oscar® every year.</p>
            <p>While the cartoons were gaining popularity in movie houses, the Disney staff found that merchandising the
                characters was an additional source of revenue. A man in New York offered Walt $300 for the license to
                put
                Mickey Mouse on some pencil tablets he was manufacturing. Walt Disney needed the $300, so he said okay.
                That
                was the start of Disney merchandising. Soon there were Mickey Mouse dolls, dishes, toothbrushes, radios,
                figurines—almost everything you could think of bore Mickey’s likeness. The year 1930 was a big one for
                the
                mouse that started it all, as it saw the first Mickey Mouse book and newspaper comic strip published.

    <div class=" wrap snow-white">
        <p>One night in 1934, Walt informed his animators that they were going to make an animated feature film, and
            then he told them the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. There were some skeptics in the group, but
            before long everyone had caught Walt’s enthusiasm, and work began in earnest. It took three years, but the
            landmark film debuted on December 21, 1937 and became a spectacular hit. Snow White soon became the
            highest-grossing film of all time, a record it held until it was surpassed by Gone with the Wind. Now Walt
            Disney’s studio had firmer footing. The short cartoons paid the bills, but Walt knew that future profits
            would come from feature films.</p>

        <p>Work immediately began on other feature projects, but just as things were looking rosy, along came World War
            II. The next two features, Pinocchio and Fantasia, were released in 1940. They were technical masterpieces,
            but their costs were too high for a company losing most of its foreign markets because of the war. Dumbo was
            made in 1941 on a very limited budget, but Bambi, in 1942, was another expensive film, and caused the studio
            to retrench. It would be many years before animated features of the highest caliber could be put into
            production.</p>

    </div>
    <p>During the war, Walt made two films in South America, Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros, at the request of
        the State Department. His studio concentrated on making propaganda and training films for the military. When the
        war ended, it was difficult for the Disney Studio to regain its pre-war footing. Several years went by with the
        release of “package” features—films such as Make Mine Music and Melody Time, containing groups of short cartoons
        packaged together. Walt also moved into live-action production with films such as So Dear to My Heart, but
        because audiences expected animation from Walt Disney, these films included animated segments. Walt opened some
        new doors by beginning the award-winning True-Life Adventure series featuring nature photography of a style
        never seen before.</p>
    <p>The year 1950 saw big successes at Disney—the first completely live-action film, Treasure Island, the return to
        classic animated features with Cinderella, and the first Disney television show at Christmas time. The Company
        was moving forward again. After two Christmas specials, Walt Disney went onto television in a big way in 1954
        with the beginning of the Disneyland anthology series. This series eventually would run on all three networks
        and go through six title changes, but it remained on the air for 29 years, making it the longest-running
        primetime television series ever. The Mickey Mouse Club, one of television’s most popular children’s series,
        debuted in 1955 and made stars of a group of talented Mouseketeers.</p>
    <p>Walt was never satisfied with what he had already accomplished. As his motion pictures and television programs
        became successful, he felt a desire to branch out. One area that intrigued him was amusement parks. As a father,
        he had taken his two young daughters to zoos, carnivals, and other entertainment enterprises, but he always
        ended up sitting on the bench as they rode the merry-go-round and had all the fun. He felt that there should be
        a park where parents and children could go and have a good time together. This was the genesis of Disneyland.
        After several years of planning and construction, the new park opened on July 17, 1955.</p>
    <div>
        <p>Disneyland was a totally new kind of park. Observers coined the term “theme park,” but even that does not
            seem to do Disneyland justice. It has been used as a pattern for every amusement park built since its
            opening, becoming internationally famous and attracting hundreds of millions of visitors. Walt said that
            Disneyland would never be completed as long as there was imagination left in the world, and that statement
            remains true today. New attractions are added regularly, and Disneyland is even more popular now than it was
            in 1955.</p>

        <div class="jungle-text">
            <p>The 1950s saw the release of the classic 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, The Shaggy Dog—first in a series
                of
                wacky comedies—and a popular TV series about the legendary hero Zorro. In the 1960s came
                Audio-Animatronics®
                technology, pioneered with Walt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room at Disneyland and then four shows at the
                1964
                New York World’s Fair, and Mary Poppins—perhaps the culmination of all Walt Disney had learned during
                his
                long movie-making career. But the ’60s also brought the end of an era: Walt Disney died December 15,
                1966.
            </p>
            <p>Plans that Walt left behind carried the Company for a number of years under the supervision of Roy
                Disney.
                The Jungle Book in 1967 and The Aristocats in 1970 showed that the Company could still make animated
                classics, and The Love Bug in 1969 was the highest-grossing film of the year. Disney began work on
                educational films and materials in a big way with the start of an educational subsidiary in 1969.</p>

    <p>After the success of Disneyland, it was only natural for Walt to consider another park on the East Coast. Prior
        to his death, the Company purchased land in Florida, and the Walt Disney World project, located on some 28,000
        acres near Orlando, was announced. It opened October 1, 1971. In Florida, the Company had the space it lacked in
        California. Finally there was room to create a destination resort, unencumbered by the urban sprawl that had
        grown up around Disneyland. Walt Disney World would include not only a Magic Kingdom theme park like Disneyland
        but also hotels, campgrounds, golf courses, and shopping villages. It did not take long for Walt Disney World to
        become the premier vacation destination in the world.</p>
    <p>Roy O. Disney, who after Walt’s death oversaw the building and financing of Walt Disney World, died in late 1971,
        and for the next decade the Company was led by a team including Card Walker, Donn Tatum, and Ron Miller—all
        originally trained by the Disney brothers. One of Walt’s last plans had been for the Experimental Prototype
        Community of Tomorrow, or EPCOT, as he called it. While he died before the plans could be refined, they were
        brought out again in a few years, and in 1979 ground was broken for the new park in Florida. EPCOT Center, a
        combination of Future World and World Showcase representing an investment of more than a billion dollars, opened
        to great acclaim October 1, 1982.</p>
    <p>WED Enterprises (later renamed Walt Disney Imagineering), the design and development division for the parks, had
        several projects in the works during the early 1980s. In addition to designing Epcot, it was hard at work on
        plans for Tokyo Disneyland, the first foreign Disney park. Tokyo Disneyland opened April 15, 1983, and was an
        immediate success in a country that had always loved anything Disney. Now that the Japanese had their own
        Disneyland, they flocked to it in increasing numbers.</p>

    <p>Moviemaking also was changing in America in the early 1980s. Audiences were diminishing for the family films that
        had been the mainstay of the Company for many years, and Disney was not meeting the competition for films that
        attracted the huge teenage and adult market. To reverse that trend, Disney established a new label, Touchstone
        Pictures, with the release of Splash in 1984. At the same time, because of the widespread perception that Disney
        stock was undervalued relative to the company’s assets, two “corporate raiders” attempted to take over Disney.
        The efforts to keep the company from being broken up ended when Michael Eisner and Frank Wells became chairman
        and president, respectively.</p>
    <p>The new management team immediately saw ways for Disney to maximize its assets. The Company had left network
        television in 1983 to prepare for the launch of a cable network, The Disney Channel. While the pay-TV service
        was successful, Eisner and Wells felt Disney should have a strong network presence as well, so in 1985 Disney’s
        Touchstone division began the immensely successful Golden Girls, followed in 1986 by a return to Sunday night
        television with the Disney Sunday Movie (later The Magical World of Disney and The Wonderful World of Disney).
        Films from the Disney library were selected for the syndication market, and some of the classic animated films
        were released on video cassette. Using the sell-through technique, Disney classics soon reached the top of the
        all-time best-seller lists.</p>
    <p>The late 1980s brought new innovations to the Parks. At Disneyland, new collaborations with filmmakers George
        Lucas and Francis Coppola brought Captain EO and Star Tours to the park, and Splash Mountain opened in 1989.
        Over at Walt Disney World in Florida, Disney’s Grand Floridian Beach and Caribbean Beach Resorts opened in 1988,
        and three new gated attractions opened in 1989: the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park, Pleasure Island, and Typhoon
        Lagoon. More resort hotels opened in 1990 and 1991.</p>
    <p>Filmmaking hit new heights in 1988 as Disney, for the first time, led Hollywood studios in box-office gross. Who
        Framed Roger Rabbit, Good Morning, Vietnam, Three Men and a Baby, and later, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Dick
        Tracy, Pretty Woman, and Sister Act each passed the $100 million milestone. Disney moved into new areas by
        starting Hollywood Pictures and acquiring the Wrather Corp. (owner of the Disneyland Hotel) and television
        station KHJ (Los Angeles), which was renamed KCAL. In merchandising, Disney purchased Childcraft and opened
        numerous highly successful and profitable Disney Stores.</p>
    <p>Disney animation began reaching even greater audiences, with The Little Mermaid being topped by Beauty and the
        Beast in 1991 which was in turn topped by Aladdin in 1992. Hollywood Records was formed to offer a wide
        selection of recordings ranging from rap to movie soundtracks. New television shows, such as Live With Regis and
        Kathy Lee, Empty Nest, Dinosaurs, and Home Improvement, expanded Disney’s television base. For the first time in
        1991, Disney moved into publishing, forming Hyperion Books, Hyperion Books for Children, and Disney Press, which
        released books on Disney and non-Disney subjects. Disney purchased Discover magazine, the leading consumer
        science monthly. As a totally new venture, Disney was awarded in 1993 the franchise for a National Hockey League
        team, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.</p>

        <p class="paris-text">Over in France, the park now known as Disneyland Paris opened on April 12, 1992. Eagerly
            anticipated, the beautifully designed park attracted almost 11 million visitors during its first year.
            Disneyland Paris is complemented by six uniquely designed resort hotels and a campground. Dixie Landings and
            Port Orleans, and a well-received Disney Vacation Club enlarged lodging possibilities at the Walt Disney
            World Resort, while Mickey’s Toontown and Indiana Jones Adventure helped increase attendance at Disneyland.
            Walt Disney World opened the All-Star Resorts, Wilderness Lodge, The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, Blizzard
            Beach, the BoardWalk Resort, Coronado Springs Resort, The Disney Institute, Downtown Disney West Side, and

        <p class="lion-text">The Disney success with animated films continued in 1994 with The Lion King, which soon
            became one of the highest-grossing films of all time. It was followed by Pocahontas in 1995, The Hunchback
            of Notre Dame in 1996, Hercules in 1997, Mulan in 1998, Tarzan in 1999, and then Fantasia/2000 at the turn
            of the century. Toy Story pioneered computer-animation techniques, and was followed by successful sequels.
            Disney also continued its strong presence in children’s animated programs for television and found success
            with sequels to animated features released directly to the video market.</p>
    </div>
    <p>In 1994, Disney ventured onto Broadway with a very successful stage production of Beauty and the Beast, followed
        in 1997 by a unique staging of a show based on The Lion King and in 2000 by Aida. By restoring the historic New
        Amsterdam Theatre on 42nd Street, Disney became the catalyst for a successful makeover of the famous Times
        Square area. A musical version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame opened in Berlin, Germany in 1999.</p>
    <p>By 1996, there were more than 450 Disney Stores worldwide, and by 1999 that number was up to 725. In Florida, the
        first home sites were sold in the new city of Celebration, located next to Walt Disney World. Eventually, 20,000
        people would call Celebration their home. After the death of the owner Gene Autry, Disney acquired the
        California Angels baseball team to add to its hockey team, and in 1997 opened Disney’s Wide World of Sports at
        Walt Disney World.</p>
    <p>Early in 1996, Disney completed its acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC. The $19 billion transaction,
        second-largest in U.S. history, brought the country’s top television network to Disney, in addition to 10 TV
        stations, 21 radio stations, seven daily newspapers, and ownership positions in four cable networks.</p>
    <p>The years that followed saw the release of a group of very popular live-action films, such as Mr. Holland’s Opus,
        The Rock, Ransom, Flubber, Con Air, Armageddon, and culminating in the hugely successful The Sixth Sense, which
        soon reached the 10th spot among the all-time highest grossing releases. Computer animation was showcased in a
        bug’s life and Dinosaur.</p>
    <p>A whole new park, Disney’s Animal Kingdom, opened at Walt Disney World in 1998. With a gigantic Tree of Life as
        its centerpiece, the park was Disney’s largest, spanning 500 acres. A major attraction was the Kilimanjaro
        Safaris, where Guests could experience live African animals in an amazingly accurate reproduction of the African
        savannah. An Asian area opened at Animal Kingdom in 1999. Back in California, Tomorrowland at Disneyland was
        redesigned in 1998.</p>
    <p>As the world moved toward a new century, Epcot became the host of Millennium Celebration, Test Track (the longest
        and fastest Disney park attraction) opened, and other attractions were revised and updated. The Walt Disney
        Company welcomed a new president—Robert A. Iger—and the Company reached the $25 billion revenue threshold for
        the first time.</p>
    <p>The year 2000 opened with the release in IMAX theaters of an almost totally new version of Fantasia entitled
        Fantasia/2000. Other classically animated features were The Emperor’s New Groove, Atlantis: The Lost Empire,
        Lilo & Stitch, Treasure Planet, and Brother Bear. Continuing collaborations with Pixar brought the
        computer-animated blockbuster Monsters, Inc. Popular live-action productions continued with Remember the Titans,
        Mission to Mars, Pearl Harbor, The Princess Diaries, and The Rookie. The new cable network, SoapNet, was
        launched, and award-winning productions on ABC included The Miracle Worker, Anne Frank, and Child Star: The
        Shirley Temple Story.</p>
    <p>DVD releases became increasingly popular, especially when the company began adding generous amounts of bonus
        material for viewers. The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs DVD in 2001 sold more than one million units on the
        first day of release.</p>
    <p>For the first time, in 2001, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts opened two new theme parks in the same year. In
        February, Disney’s California Adventure opened after several years of major construction, which transformed the
        entire Anaheim area. The new park celebrated the history, culture, and spirit of California, with areas ranging
        from a Hollywood Pictures Backlot to the amusements of Paradise Pier. Joining it was an upscale shopping area,
        Downtown Disney and the Grand Californian Hotel, celebrating the Craftsman style of architecture. Across the
        Pacific in Japan, Tokyo DisneySea opened in September, looking to the myths, legends, and lore of the ocean as
        the inspiration for its attractions and shows. March 2002 saw the opening of another foreign park, Walt Disney
        Studios, featuring the history and lore and excitement of the movies, adjacent to Disneyland Paris. Ground was
        broken in January 2003 for Hong Kong Disneyland.</p>
    <p>In 2001, The Walt Disney Company honored the 100th Anniversary of the birth of its founder, Walt Disney. The
